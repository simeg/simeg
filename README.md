## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Simon. I enjoy writing code, and tech in general ğŸ¤“

I sometimes write at [dotlog](https://simeg.github.io/).

**My latest projects:**
- [bash-cli-spinners](https://github.com/simeg/bash-cli-spinners) - ğŸŒˆ +80 Bash/Zsh spinners for scripts and terminal
- [git-x](https://github.com/simeg/git-x) - âœ¨ Git extensions that feel like they should have been part of Git from the start
