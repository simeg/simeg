## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simon. I enjoy writing code, and tech in general ðŸ¤“

I've written a book, "[Commit to Cloud - Beginnerâ€™s Guide to DevOps with GitHub Actions & AWS](https://prplcode.gumroad.com/l/commit-to-cloud)"! ðŸ“š

I sometimes write at [dotlog](https://simeg.github.io/).

## My Latest Projects

- [git-x](https://github.com/simeg/git-x) - Git extensions that feel like they belonged in Git from the start

## My CLI Rust Projects
- [eureka](https://github.com/simeg/eureka) â€“ CLI tool to input and store your ideas without leaving the terminal
