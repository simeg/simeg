## Hi there 👋

I'm Simon 🤓

I build things, break things, and occasionally write down what I wish I’d learned sooner.

### 📘 I wrote a book
**[Commit to Cloud — Beginner’s Guide to DevOps with GitHub Actions & AWS](https://prplcode.gumroad.com/l/commit-to-cloud)**

A practical, beginner-friendly guide to shipping real CI/CD pipelines with:
- GitHub Actions
- AWS
- Hands-on examples (no toy demos)

If you're moving from “I kinda get CI” to “I can actually ship this,” this is for you.

I sometimes write at [dotlog](https://simeg.github.io/).
