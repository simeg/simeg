## Hi there 👋

I'm Simon. I enjoy writing code, and tech in general 🤓

I sometimes write at [dotlog](https://simeg.github.io/).

## My latest projects
- [bash-cli-spinners](https://github.com/simeg/bash-cli-spinners) - +80 Bash/Zsh spinners for scripts and terminal
- [git-x](https://github.com/simeg/git-x) - Git extensions that feel like they should have been part of Git from the start

## My CLI Rust Projects
- [eureka](https://github.com/simeg/eureka) – CLI tool to input and store your ideas without leaving the terminal
- [git-x](https://github.com/simeg/git-x) – Git extensions that feel like they should have been part of Git from the start
- [urlsup](https://github.com/simeg/urlsup) – CLI to find broken URLs in files (`awesome_bot` alternative but significantly faster)
- [commentective](https://github.com/simeg/commentective) – CLI tool to locate comments and commented out code in your source code
- [stava](https://github.com/simeg/stava) – CLI spell checker
